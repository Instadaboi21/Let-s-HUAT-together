# Let-s-HUAT-together

Hello 1H! This is the story I would like to make, with all the memories of our class this year combined together. You can add the funny moments in class or memorable quotes. Hope to see the final result!

_Rules:_

1. **Always** ask for the person's permission before adding their story/quote (I trust you so any story ideas I'll just add)
2. Be nice. No rude words/vulgarities unless it is part of the story (I'll check for them and will contact you if I see any of these and ask)
3. Submit at least 3 pull requests per person. I would like them to be meaningful, so do put some thoughts into them! This is a class activity so I would like everyone to participate!

I trust that you all should have a lot of exciting memories with your classmates, feel free to add them in but remember rule no. 1! Also, don't be afraid to add your own funny stories/quotes in! The more the merrier! ( •̀ ω •́ )✧
